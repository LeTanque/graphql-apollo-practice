##### Notes

> We recommend that teams practice Schema First Development and agree upon the schema first before any API development begins.

> A scalar type is a primitive type like ID, String, Boolean, or Int. You can define custom scalars, like Date.

# Apollo tutorial
#### File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `start`: Starting point for the tutorial
- `final`: Final version

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

#### Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd final/server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd final/client && npm i && npm start
```
